     * All times are in units relative to the current time (0). All constraints
     * are soft, i.e. lateness at service locations and at depot are allowed.

     * @param travelTime <code>n x n</code> distance matrix expressed in time:
     *            <code>travelTime[i][j]</code> specifies travelTime from
     *            location <code>i</code> to location <code>j</code>.
     * @param releaseDates specifies the left side of the time window for every
     *            location (hard constraint, earlier is not allowed).

     *            location (soft constraint, lateness is allowed).

     *            <code>servicePairs[i][0]</code> and
     *            <code>servicePairs[i][1]</code> specify the pickup and
     *            delivery location respectively. Each location may occur at
     *            maximum once in the matrix (either as an pickup or as a
     *            delivery).
     * @param vehicleLocation specifies the location index where the vehicle is
     *            currently. It is assumed that when a vehicle is at a customer
     *            location, all customer interactions are done.
     * @param serviceTimes specifies the service time for all locations (both
     *            pickups and deliveries).
     * @return The solution object which indicates a (usually the best found)
     *         solution for the single vehilce PDPTW.
