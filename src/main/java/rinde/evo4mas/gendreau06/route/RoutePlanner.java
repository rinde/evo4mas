/**
 * This is a route planner interface. It is unusual in the sense that it reveals
 * its future destinations one hop at a time. The future destinations are hidden
 * deliberatly, they may not be known at a certain time. This allows a more
 * flexible routeplanner, internally the future hops may change repeatedly. The
 * routeplanner is always coupled to one {@link Truck}, the routeplanner plans
 * its routes for this truck instance.
 * <p>
 * <b>Initialization</b> {@link RoutePlanner} instances should be initialized in
 * a uniform manner. The methods should be called in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>constructor</li>
 * <li>{@link #init(RoadModel, PDPModel, DefaultVehicle)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #update(Collection, long)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * Once these methods are called in this order, {@link #next(long)} may be
 * called. {@link #update(Collection, long)} may be called more than once. All
 * implementations of this interface should throw {@link IllegalStateException}s
 * when these methods are called in an incorrect order (as defined by the test
 * class).
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b> Once the initialization is complete, {@link #current()} will
 * return the parcel that should be visited next (if there are any parcels of
 * course). The implementation should guarantee that any subsequent invocations
 * of {@link #current()} should always return the same value. That is, unless
 * one of the two <i>modifying</i> methods are called:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #update(Collection, long)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #next(long)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each time one of these is called the route <i>may</i> change. When
 * {@link #next(long)} is called, the value of {@link #current()} is saved into
 * its history (accesible via {@link #getHistory()}) and accesible via
 * {@link #prev()}.
